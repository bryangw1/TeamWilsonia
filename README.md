# Team Wilsonia
## Merry Christmas 2019
2019 wound up being a very busy year for the Wilsons. Allen and Sandy bought a new condo in Florida that they will be leasing through [VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/1778476?fbclid=IwAR0iZaIreG3OeZH9NefTc-hEQQSiP8NzcCwZnhRH1jpORqv1KzvNexEpWBw). Mallory and Kyle, in addition to remodeling their kitchen, have been traveling very frequently to weddings all over the place. And Bryan quit his job, traveled around Europe for a month, and started new work as the Editor-in-Chief for the [MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu/). 

In adding upon last year's theme, I have added a few new features to this year's edition of [teamwilsonia.com](http://teamwilsonia.com/). Most notably, there is now space for each of you to upload photos and descriptions of your past year for everyone to see.

By opening up the Google Slides Presentation and adding a new slide for an event or moment that you want to highlight, those changes will be automatically update this website. Below are overviews for Allen and Sandy, Kyle and Mallory, myself, and the Stones. The only remaining step is for you to send me your email and then you are free to start adding whatever you want!

## Merry Christmas 2018
  
The Wilsons have had quite the adventurous year. Mallory and Kyle's wedding was the high watermark for a year that saw many once-in-a-lifetime moments. For those unable to attend, it was truly one of the most beautiful occurrences that anyone has ever had the luxury to be a part of. It is hard not to be confident in the combined strength of such ernest, genuine, steadfast, and interesting families. 
  
Rather than sending out a letter to people that could be gone in an instant, this website is maintained using a form of version control called [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) that enables everyone to contribute. Perhaps the biggest benefit to such an obtuse concept is that over time, as the story grows, this series of changes, edits, and commits can serve as an on-going record of the important things that happened that all may refer back to.

As the new year comes and goes, I hope that we can all live by words that may as well be emblazoned on the Wilson sigil:

#### *Do what's right, not what's easy.*
